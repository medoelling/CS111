- CLOCK_REALTIME is used to get the finishing time of a process. 
- CLOCK_MONOTONIC is used to get the real time of a process. This is
  because CLOCK_MONOTONIC can never be reset. 

Lab 1c questions:

1. Yes.
   The first column should always be in nondecreasing order.
   This is because all commands are executed sequentially. And the log
   should report times of processes in the exactly order in which
   they exit.

2. Yes.
   If we add the following loop to one of the child processes:

   int i = 0;
   while(i < 10000000)
   	   i++;

   Then we can manually increase the user time of this process.

3. No.
   The real time is obtained using the CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock id,
   which can never be reset. The user and system time is returned
   from getrusage(). Therefore, if any of these is negative, it means
   that the process finishes before it starts, which is not possible.

4. I used pipe, sequence, and 'sleep' commands to check.
   If the first column of the log file is in nondecreasing order,
   then the lines are not interleaved. 
   These test cases are included in 'mytest.sh'
